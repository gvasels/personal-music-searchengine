The frontend integrates with the completed backend API (Epics 1-4) to provide a full-featured music library experience.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis epic delivers the user-facing application that brings together all backend capabilities:\n- **Upload & Organization**: Drag-drop file uploads with progress tracking\n- **Music Library**: Browse tracks, albums, and artists with rich metadata\n- **Search & Discovery**: Full-text search with filters and autocomplete\n- **Playback**: Stream audio with HLS adaptive bitrate support\n- **Playlists & Tags**: Create playlists and organize with custom tags\n\n## Requirements\n\n### REQ-5.1: Authentication & Session Management\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want to sign in with my email and password, so that I can access my personal music library securely.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN user navigates to the app without authentication THEN system SHALL redirect to login page\n2.

WHEN user navigates to artists view THEN system SHALL display artist list with track/album counts\n4. WHEN user clicks artist THEN system SHALL navigate to artist page with albums and tracks\n5. WHEN user clicks \"Play All\" on album/artist THEN system SHALL queue all tracks and start playback\n\n### REQ-5.5: File Upload\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload audio files, so that I can add music to my library.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN user drags files onto upload zone THEN system SHALL validate file types and show preview\n2. WHEN user confirms upload THEN system SHALL request presigned URL and upload directly to S3\n3. WHEN file is uploading THEN system SHALL display progress bar with percentage\n4. WHEN upload completes THEN system SHALL confirm upload and trigger backend processing\n5. IF upload fails THEN system SHALL display error message and allow retry\n6. WHEN processing completes THEN system SHALL show new track in library with extracted metadata\n\n### REQ-5.6: Audio Player\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want to play my music with standard playback controls, so that I can listen to my library.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN user starts playback THEN system SHALL display persistent player bar at bottom\n2. WHEN user clicks play/pause THEN system SHALL toggle playback state\n3. WHEN user drags progress slider THEN system SHALL seek to that position\n4. WHEN user adjusts volume THEN system SHALL change volume and persist preference\n5. WHEN track ends THEN system SHALL play next track in queue (if any)\n6. WHEN user clicks next/previous THEN system SHALL skip to adjacent track in queue\n\n### REQ-5.7: Play Queue Management\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage a play queue, so that I can control what plays next.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN user adds track to queue THEN system SHALL append to end of current queue\n2. WHEN user clicks \"Play Next\" THEN system SHALL insert track after current track\n3. WHEN user opens queue view THEN system SHALL display ordered list of queued tracks\n4. WHEN user drags track in queue THEN system SHALL reorder queue\n5. WHEN user removes track from queue THEN system SHALL remove and update queue state\n6. WHEN user toggles shuffle THEN system SHALL randomize/restore queue order\n\n### REQ-5.8: Search\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want to search my music library, so that I can quickly find specific tracks.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN user types in search box THEN system SHALL display autocomplete suggestions after 300ms debounce\n2. WHEN user submits search THEN system SHALL display search results page with tracks\n3. WHEN user applies filter (artist, album, genre, tag) THEN system SHALL refine results\n4. WHEN user clicks search result THEN system SHALL navigate to that item\n5.
